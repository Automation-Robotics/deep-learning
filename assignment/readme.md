Dataset: Training a robot to understand sign language dataset.

This dataset is publicly available on https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhabanerjee/training-a-robot-to-understand-sign-language/version/1.
This dataset is a repository of sign language images taken by the Anki Vector robot.

 

The goal for this problem is to familiarise you with deep learning and computer vision techniques. Use TensorFlow or PyTorch frameworks to finish this problem.



First, build from scratch a deep convolutional neural network model. By training the model multiple times, you need to find out which is the best architecture for it â€“ for example,
the best number of layers and the best optimiser. Consider using techniques such as dropout or batch normalisation. 

 

Second, build the convolutional neural network using transfer learning from a pre-trained network. A pre-trained model is a saved network that was previously trained with a large dataset,
 typically from a large-scale image-classification task. Popular pre-trained models include AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, SqueezeNet, DenseNet, Inception v3, GoogLeNet, ShuffleNet v2, MobileNet v2,
  ResNeXt, Wide ResNet or MNASNet.



Finally, compare the performance between two models and state which one is better and why.
